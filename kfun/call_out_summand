NAME
	call_out_summand - call function with delay, once

SYNOPSIS
	int call_out_summand(string function, mixed delay, float summand,
			     mixed args...)


DESCRIPTION
	This function works like call_out, but any followup uses of
	call_out_summand within the same object, done before the pending call
	is due, will not start another delayed call; instead, the summand
	argument will be added to that of the pending call.  All other
	arguments in a followup call will be ignored, and do not need to
	match those of the pending call.
	The returned value is 1 if a delayed call was started or added to,
	or 0 in the case of a failure.

ERRORS
	If the number of active delayed calls in the system is equal to the
	value of the ST_COTABSIZE field of the array returned by status(),
	where ST_COTABSIZE is defined in the include file <status.h>,
	attempting to add another one will result in an error.
	If the maximum number of callouts is set to 0, no delayed call will
	be added, and no error will be caused.
