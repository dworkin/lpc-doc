NAME
	restore_object - restore variables of an object

SYNOPSIS
	int restore_object(string file)

DESCRIPTION
	Restore all global variables in an object that are not private or
	static from a file.  All variables which qualify, but were not
	restored and do not contain object values, will be set to 0 or nil.
	1 is returned if the variables could be restored, 0 otherwise.

ERRORS
	An error will result if the restore file does not have the proper
	format.

EXAMPLES
	string filename;

	filename = "/data/players/" + this_object->query_name() + ".o";
	if (!restore_object(filename) {
		write("Failure to load: " + filename + "\n");
	}
