NAME
	sscanf - simple string parser

SYNOPSIS
	int sscanf(string str, string fmt, ...)

DESCRIPTION
	Parse the string str, using the format string fmt.  The following
	character sequences have a special meaning in the format string:

		%s	match a substring
		%d	match a number
		%f	match a floating-point number
		%c	match a character
		%%	match single %

	Other characters must be matched exactly.  %*s, %*d, %*f and %*c
	can be used to match without assignment.  Matched substrings and
	numbers are assigned to the successive lvalue arguments following the
	format string.  The number of matched substrings and numbers is
	returned.

ERRORS
	An error is caused if the format string is malformed, or if too few
	lvalue arguments were given.

EXAMPLES
	string cmd, message;
	int x;

	message = "do_mail 5";

	if (sscanf(message, "%s %d", cmd, x) != 2) {
		write("Error in statment.\n");
		usage();
	}
