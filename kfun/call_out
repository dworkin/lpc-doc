NAME
	call_out - call function with delay

SYNOPSIS
	int call_out(string function, mixed delay, mixed args...)

DESCRIPTION
	Call a function in the current object with a delay.  The function to
	be called must not be private.  The delay is specified in seconds.
	The minimum delay is 0 seconds, for a function that is to be called
	as soon as possible after termination of the current task.
	If the delay is an integer, the function will be called after
	approximately the specified number of seconds.  Otherwise, the delay
	must be a floating point number, and the function will be called with a
	millisecond resolution.
	The returned value is the callout handle, an integer > 0 which must be
	used if the callout is to be removed.

ERRORS
	If the number of active delayed calls in the system is equal to the
	value of the ST_COTABSIZE field of the array returned by status(),
	where ST_COTABSIZE is defined in the include file <status.h>,
	attempting to add another one will result in an error.
	If the maximum number of callouts is set to 0, no delayed call will
	be added, and no error will be caused.

EXAMPLES
	int x;

	x = call_out("save_me", 0);

	if (x) { 
		write("Saved player.\n");
	}

	x = call_out("do_quit", 5);
