NAME
	remove_call_out - remove a delayed call to a function

SYNOPSIS
	mixed remove_call_out(int handle)

DESCRIPTION
	Remove the callout associated with handle.  The delay after which the
	function would have been called is returned.  The delay is an integer
	or a floating point number, depending on how the callout was started.
	If there is no scheduled call associated with the handle in the current
	object, return -1.

EXAMPLES
	int x;

	write("Quitting.");
	x = call_out("do_quit", 500);
	write("Just kidding.\n");

	x = remove_call_out(x);
	write("That was close would have exited in " + x + ".\n");
