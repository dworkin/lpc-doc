NAME
	asn_div - divide one arbitrary size number by another

SYNOPSIS
	string asn_div(string a, string b, string m)

DESCRIPTION
	Compute a divided by b modulo m.  The modulus must be larger than zero.
	Arbitrary size numbers are encoded as strings, most significant byte
	first.  The most significant bit in the first byte, when set, indicates
	that the number is negative and encoded in two's complement.

ERRORS
	An error will result if the modulus is less than or equal to zero, or
	if b is equal to zero.

EXAMPLES
	string res, a, b, m;

	a = "11111111";
	b = "2";
	m = "1";

	res = asn_div(a, b, m);
	write("RES = asn_div(" + a + ", " + b + ", " + m + ") = " + 
		res + "\n");
