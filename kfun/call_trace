NAME
	call_trace - return the function call trace

SYNOPSIS
	mixed **call_trace()

DESCRIPTION
	Return the function call trace as an array.  The elements are of
	the following format:

		({ objname, progname, function, line, extern, arg1, ..., argn })

	The line number is 0 if the function is in a compiled object.
	Extern is 1 if the function was called with call_other(), and 0
	otherwise.
	The offsets in the array are named in the include file <trace.h>.
	The last element of the returned array is the trace of the
	current function.

EXAMPLES
	mixed **stack;
	int i, maxi;

	stack = call_trace();
	maxi = sizeof(stack);

	for (i = 0; i < maxi; i++) {
		write(stack[i][0] + ": " + stack[i][1] + ": " + stack[i][2] + 
			": " + stack[i][3] + "\n");
	}
